## Assignment 2

- Form a group of 5 and send me an e-mail (d.kurowicka@tudelft.nl) with names and student numbers of students in each group.
- Choose one year of data http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive: 2016
- First you have to pre-prepare the file (remove stopwords, do stemming etc… to extract the text for the analysis where you have only ‘important’ words and similar words are identified) *Keep this pre-prepared file as it will be used on other assignment later on in this course*
- Analyse these tweets (check if everything went well with stem procedure by comparing original tweets and words after stemming, analyse the most frequent words etc. )
- Perform clustering analysis with different methods K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical
- Compare the results from different clustering algorithms
- Analyze the optimal number of clusters, and what different clusters are about.
- Check few randomly chosen, original tweets to see if indeed the tweets were properly divided by subject with clustering algorithms.
- Be resourceful and *try to impress me* with your analysis.
- Send me report with your analysis - **deadline 22.03.2019 at 24.00**
- Include the copy of the implementation in the end of the report. Also send the file with tweet analysis implementation.
- Since it is a group work I would like you to indicate in your report who did what (group assessment where you will evaluate the group members for the involvement in this assignment).
